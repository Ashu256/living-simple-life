                <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I jad so many things that I thought
                    that I loved, but the truth was  I couldn't even appreciate any of it becuase there 
                    was too much.</p>
                <p>Things were terrible. I had job that I hated, a home that I didn't want ot
                    live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship. </p>

                <h3 class="about-secondary-title"> >How I turned things around</h3>
                <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>. 
                    I literally put 90% of my possession in the garbage, sold my place and moved into 
                    a smaller aparment, and I quit my job.</p>
                <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I 
                    didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>

                <h3 class="about-secondary-title"> >Now I live the simple life.</h3>    
                <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed,
                    enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time ot enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I gad no choice but 
                    to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a 
                    simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
